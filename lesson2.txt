git add

Now I learnt how to commit.

Git status shows whast files are modified.
Then u have to add to staging area. Then run commit.

create new branch by 

git branch name

check it out to change branch.

git checkout branchname


Draw branch diagram to enable you to visually see which commits are reachable, and which branches exist at which point.
