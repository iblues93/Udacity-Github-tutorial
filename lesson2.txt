git add

Now I learnt how to commit.

Git status shows whast files are modified.
Then u have to add to staging area. Then run commit.

create new branch by 

git branch name

check it out to change branch.

git checkout branchname


Draw branch diagram to enable you to visually see which commits are reachable, and which branches exist at which point.

Merging two branches, to save all changes made by everyone into a file.

git merge (branch) : this merge the branch into the current branch checked out.

git merge b1 b2 : merge current branch with b1 and b2

Automatic merging, software merges the changes with reference to one another and the point of origin. 

Manual conflict resolving allows professionals to manually examine more carefully to prevent errors made by the software. Its less taxing on the software.
